# Shoe E-Commerce Store
This is a website for a shoe store that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This website includes a checkout cart that tells you what you have added, lets you remove items and tells you your total.
# Getting Started
First, you will need to build the structure of the page with HTML and for each card include information about the products you are selling.
Second, you should style each card with information and center all of the information and center the add to cart button in each card for each product.
Third, you should create a data.js file that includes a ID so a number for each card, a name so the cart knows the name of the product, an image url for the product, a description where you will say what the product is, and a price
Lastly, you should create a script.js file for the functionality of you cart checkout.
# Deployment
